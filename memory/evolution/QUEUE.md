# Evolution Queue — Clarvis

_Pick from here every heartbeat. Small tasks: do now. Big tasks: spawn Claude Code._
_Priority: P0 (do now) > P1 (this week) > P2 (when idle)_
_Completed items archived by `clarvis.queue.writer.archive_completed()` to QUEUE_ARCHIVE.md._
_Caps: P0 ≤ 10, P1 ≤ 15. Triage before adding. See docs/PROJECT_LANES.md for rules._
_Deep audit tracker: `docs/internal/audits/CLARVIS_DEEP_AUDIT_PLAN_2026-04-16.md` (existing P1 audit items map to phases there — do not duplicate). Quick-reference: `docs/internal/audits/AUDIT_INDEX.md`._

## P0 — Current Sprint (2026-04-15)

_Audit-phase override: while executing the deep Clarvis audit plan, do not suppress or skip justified follow-up queue items merely because P1 is over cap. Audit-derived findings may add P1/P2 tasks when they are necessary to preserve audit continuity and evidence integrity. Triage still applies, but cap pressure must not block recording valid findings._

### Critical Pipeline Fixes


### Deep Audit (anchor for canonical audit tracker)


### Execution Governance (added 2026-04-15 — prevents SWO-style drift)


### Deep Audit — Phase 9 Follow-ups (added 2026-04-17)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/NEURO_FEATURE_DECISIONS_2026-04-17.md`. Phase 9 scored 16 neuro features via proxy-EVS/TCS (no A/B data). 2 PROMOTE, 6 KEEP, 4 REVISE, 4 SHADOW, 0 DEMOTE. Critical defect: world_models calibration loop broken._


### Bugs

## P1 — This Week

### Claude Design & Routines Integration (cross-project, added 2026-04-20)

_Source: `docs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_ROUTINES_STRATEGY.md`. Cross-project operating model for Claude Design + Claude Code Routines._

- [ ] **[ROUTINE_SWO_POST_MERGE]** Set up a Claude Code Routine (GitHub webhook trigger: `pull_request.closed` + `merged=true`) on the SWO repo for post-merge build/test verification. Prompt: clone, `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm test`, report failures as GitHub issue. Deliverable: working Routine. (PROJECT:SWO)
- [ ] **[ROUTINE_CLARVIS_SPINE_TEST]** Set up a Claude Code Routine (GitHub webhook trigger: PR touching `clarvis/` directory) on the Clarvis repo for automated spine test gate. Prompt: run `python3 -m pytest tests/` and post results as PR comment. Deliverable: working Routine.
- [ ] **[ROUTINES_MANIFEST_SPEC]** Define the `.clarvis/routines.yaml` manifest format for per-project Routine declarations. Write spec doc and create example manifests for SWO and Clarvis repos. Deliverable: `docs/ROUTINES_MANIFEST.md` + example YAML files.

### Star Sanctuary — Foundation PRs (PROJECT:SWO)

_SWO tasks tracked here. When project lane is active, these get priority. See also: memory/evolution/SWO_TRACKER.md_
_Deep Sanctuary Review completed 2026-04-20 (DEV @ `3e8f802`). Build ✓, 128/128 tests ✓. V1.0+V1.5 features complete in code._
_Style doctrine: `docs/SANCTUARY_STYLE_DOCTRINE.md` — binding on all visual work. Core rule: luminous cosmic pixel-art compatible with existing Skrumpey sprite language. NOT grimdark, NOT generic dark fantasy._
_Asset prep completed 2026-04-20: `CompanionSprite` + `LocationIcon` components with sprite→emoji fallback, `public/sanctuary/` directory structure, Sanctuary CSS keyframes (idle-bob, happy-bounce, sleepy-sway, sparkle, twinkle, glow-pulse). Ready for asset drop-in._

#### Visual Polish & Animation (highest-value UX improvements)

- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_LAYERED_ART_STRATEGY]** **OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT.** Canonical art already renders well. If desired: (1) extract transparent/no-background variants for overlay use, (2) composite mood-effect overlays on top of NFT art, (3) investigate IPFS metadata `attributes` for layer-specific rendering. Low priority since full NFT art already shows correctly. (PROJECT:SWO)
- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_MAP_VISUAL]** **ASSET-ONLY — CSS class `.sanctuary-map-bg` ready.** Need 720×405 pixel-art star-map with 8 luminous location zones at positions matching DB `position_x/y`. **Style: dark cosmic base (#0a0a1a) with warm glowing terrain zones — think constellation map with cozy islands, NOT detailed Zelda overworld. Each zone uses its doctrine accent color (amber for Hot Springs, teal for Star Garden, etc).** Scattered 1-2px star dots. `LocationIcon` component ready for 64×64 location vignettes (optional). Asset workflow: Retro Diffusion / Aseprite. (PROJECT:SWO)
- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_ANIMATIONS]** **PARTIALLY DONE — CSS keyframes added (sanctuaryIdleBob, sanctuaryHappyBounce, sanctuarySleepySway, sanctuarySparkle, sanctuaryGlowPulse, sanctuaryBarFill).** Remaining: (1) wire `sanctuaryBarFill` to StatBar on bond/XP gain, (2) add sparkle burst on activity completion (replace plain ✅), (3) add typing indicator dots for chat, (4) add `sanctuaryStarTwinkle` to map background stars. (PROJECT:SWO)
- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_EMPTY_STATES]** **PARTIALLY DONE — (1) no-companion now shows `CompanionPicker` with real NFT image grid + selection flow.** Remaining: (2) empty journal: pixel-art open book illustration, (3) quests empty: fix "Loading quests..." permanent state when API returns empty array, (4) traits empty: encouraging progress message. (PROJECT:SWO)
- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_SOUND_DESIGN]** Add optional ambient sound layer. `public/sanctuary/sfx/` directory ready. Muted by default, toggle in UI. Lower priority — visual assets first. (PROJECT:SWO)

#### Functional Gaps & Improvements

- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_CHAT_LLM]** Upgrade companion chat from template-based responses to LLM-backed (per ADR-002). Use OpenRouter → Gemini Flash for personality-aware responses. Rate limit: 15/day. Inject: companion personality, bond level, recent journal context. Estimated cost: $0.05/day at 100 users. Currently the 10 constellation templates produce repetitive responses. (PROJECT:SWO)
- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_COMPANION_SELECT_UI]** No companion selection UI exists — if a user has multiple Skrumpeys, there's no way to switch in the frontend. The API supports `select` and `switch` but the UI only shows the active companion. Add a companion picker/gallery in the Sanctuary header. (PROJECT:SWO)
- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_ACTIVITY_FEEDBACK]** When sending companion to activity, there's no confirmation or preview of duration/rewards. Add: (1) duration preview per location before sending, (2) expected rewards tooltip, (3) activity-in-progress visual on the map (companion icon at location), (4) push notification or visual cue when activity completes. (PROJECT:SWO)
- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_RESPONSIVE]** Test and fix mobile responsiveness. The 2-column grid (`md:grid-cols-2`) collapses on mobile but: (1) world map 16:9 aspect may be too small on phones, (2) 6-7px text sizes are unreadable on mobile, (3) interaction buttons may be too small for touch targets (40px minimum recommended), (4) chat input/send layout needs mobile treatment. (PROJECT:SWO)

#### Testing & Quality

- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_E2E_TESTS]** Add end-to-end test coverage for the full Sanctuary flow: (1) wallet connect → companion select → interact → journal appears, (2) send to activity → wait → complete → rewards, (3) chat send/receive, (4) quest progress → claim reward, (5) trait unlock, (6) public map view without wallet. Current tests only cover DB-layer unit scenarios. Use Playwright or Vitest browser mode. (PROJECT:SWO)
- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_API_VALIDATION]** Harden API input validation: several routes accept `address` and `token_id` from query params without format validation (e.g., address could be non-hex, token_id could be negative). Add Zod schemas or manual validation at route boundaries. (PROJECT:SWO)

#### Future Phases (P2 candidates, from milestones)

- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_COSMETICS_SHOP]** Implement P3.1+P3.2 from milestones: cosmetic items schema + STAR shop UI. The `equipped_cosmetics` column exists but is never written. Seed 15-25 items across 5 categories. This is the primary STAR token sink. (PROJECT:SWO)
- [ ] **[SWO_SANCTUARY_EXPEDITIONS]** Implement expedition system (tables exist, routes are stubs). Multi-step adventures with narrative choices per P4.3 milestone. Currently all expedition functions throw "not implemented". (PROJECT:SWO)




### Deep Audit — Phase 9 Follow-ups (P1, added 2026-04-17)


### Phase 8 Follow-ups (P1, added 2026-04-16)


### Deep Audit — Verification Program (added 2026-04-20)

_3-phase verification pass over the completed 16-phase deep audit + 100+ queue items. Confirms work quality, identifies regressions, flags fragile areas. Each phase covers ~6 audit areas. Source: operator-requested audit-of-the-audit._


### Clarvis Maintenance — Keep Alive


### Deep Audit — Phase 0 Follow-ups (added 2026-04-16 via AUDIT_CAP_OVERRIDE)

_Recorded under the audit-cap override (§P0 banner). P1 is currently 19/15 in base terms but within the 25-ceiling for audit sources. These are justified Phase 0 follow-ups; closing them is a precondition for a valid Phase 0 PASS ruling and for downstream phases. See `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-16_phase0_instrumentation.md`._


### Deep Audit — Phase 2 Follow-ups (added 2026-04-16 via AUDIT_CAP_OVERRIDE)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/SPINE_MODULE_SCORECARD_2026-04-16.md` + `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-16_phase2_spine_quality.md`. Phase 2 ruled 1 PASS, 13 REVISE, 0 DEMOTE/ARCHIVE on 14 spine modules — most of the REVISE work is small `__init__.py` surface trims and cheap coverage lifts. Only 1 P1 (the new `clarvis/audit/` module needs tests — substrate is live but untested)._


### Deep Audit — Phase 3 Follow-ups (added 2026-04-16 via AUDIT_CAP_OVERRIDE)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/PROMPT_ASSEMBLY_SCORECARD_2026-04-16.md` + `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-16_phase3_prompt_assembly.md`. Phase 3 ruled 5×PASS across task types on 334 scored episodes; aggregate gate PASS. Open follow-ups address proxy limits (MISLEADING detection, trace-backed rescore) and one hand-label task. No assembly code paths were changed by this phase._


### Deep Audit — Phase 4 Follow-ups (added 2026-04-16 via AUDIT_CAP_OVERRIDE)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/BRAIN_USEFULNESS_2026-04-16.md` + `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-16_phase4_brain_usefulness.md`. Phase 4 ruled INSUFFICIENT_DATA × 10 collections on the attribution gate — blocked by two Phase-0 capture gaps (listed below, the P0 item being the most severe). One independent REVISE flagged on routing. `scripts/audit/brain_attribution.py` + `data/audit/brain_attribution.jsonl` + `data/audit/brain_collection_scorecard.json` shipped. All items use `source="audit_phase_4"`._


### Deep Audit — Phase 6 Follow-ups (added 2026-04-16 via AUDIT_CAP_OVERRIDE)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-16_phase6_execution_routing_queue.md`. Phase 6 ruled REVISE overall: router PASS (98.9% accuracy, PROMOTE candidate), autofill PASS (2.4% stale), caps REVISE (21/30 days), spawn PASS, slot share FAIL (12.5% vs 50%). All items use `source="audit_phase_6"`._


### Deep Audit — Meta-Audit Follow-ups (added 2026-04-16 via AUDIT_CAP_OVERRIDE)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-16_meta_audit_phases_0_4.md`. A sharpness-check on Phases 0–4 found the program well-executed but framed too narrowly toward removal. Corrections: add code-review axis to Phase 2, wire operator-in-the-loop EVS signal, content-quality spot check for Phase 4. Plan §0 principle 7 + PROMOTE gate already landed in the plan doc. All items use `source="audit_meta"`._

## P2 — When Idle
- [~] [STALLED] **[AUDIT_PHASE_0_INSTRUMENTATION]** Implement the Phase 0 measurement substrate that blocks every downstream audit phase: (1) per-spawn `audit_trace_id` linking preflight→execution→postflight→outcome, (2) `data/audit/traces/<date>/<id>.json` writer with ≥45d retention, (3) `data/audit/feature_toggles.json` registry supporting `shadow` mode, (4) `scripts/audit/trace_exporter.py` CLI, (5) `scripts/audit/replay.py` for deterministic prompt rebuild. PASS gate: ≥95% of real Claude spawns in a 7-day window have a complete recoverable trace. Canonical plan: `docs/internal/audits/CLARVIS_DEEP_AUDIT_PLAN_2026-04-16.md`. (2026-04-16: substrate shipped — `clarvis/audit/{trace,toggles}.py`, trace_exporter + replay CLIs, spawn_claude + heartbeat wiring, `audit_trace_id` on CostEntry. Awaiting 7-day trace window before PASS ruling. Decision doc: `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-16_phase0_instrumentation.md`.) (2026-04-20 corrected assessment: 106 traces across 5 days (Apr 16–20). By source: heartbeat 43/43 complete (100%), spawn_claude 59/61 have outcome (96.7% — 2 missing outcome.status), 2 test traces excluded. Combined: 102/104 non-test = 98.1% completeness, above 95% gate. 7-day window not yet met — 5/7 days elapsed, eval on or after 2026-04-23.)

### Claude Design & Routines — Medium-term (P2, added 2026-04-20)

_Source: `docs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_ROUTINES_STRATEGY.md` §6 Phase 2-3._

- [ ] **[ROUTINE_SWO_DOCS_DRIFT]** Set up weekly scheduled Routine for SWO: compare API route handlers with `docs/API.md` and `docs/DEPLOYED.md`, flag stale references, open PR if drift found.
- [ ] **[ROUTINE_QUEUE_HYGIENE]** Set up weekly scheduled Routine for Clarvis repo: scan QUEUE.md for cap violations, stale items (>14 days no progress), missing source references. Post report to Telegram.
- [ ] **[ROUTINE_MANAGER_SCRIPT]** Build `scripts/infra/routine_manager.py` that reads `.clarvis/routines.yaml` from a project repo and provisions/updates Routines via the Anthropic API (`POST /v1/claude_code/routines/{id}/fire`). CLI: `routine_manager.py provision|list|fire|status`.

### Demoted from P1 (2026-04-16, cap triage)

_Demoted to P2 to bring P1 within 25-ceiling. All are review/sweep/benchmark tasks not blocking audit gates or project delivery._


### Phase 6 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-16)


### Deep Audit — Meta-Audit Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-16 via AUDIT_CAP_OVERRIDE)


### Graph Integration (P2, added 2026-04-18)


### Phase 4.5 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-16)


### Phase 8 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-16)


### Deep Audit — Phase 9 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-17)

- [~] [BLOCKED:2026-05-01] **[PHASE9_REEVAL_WITH_AB]** After `[PHASE9_AB_TOGGLE_WIRING]` completes and 14-day A/B windows are collected for the 4 SHADOW features, re-run Phase 9 EVS scoring with causal data instead of proxies. Update `data/audit/neuro_feature_scorecard.jsonl` and `NEURO_FEATURE_DECISIONS_2026-04-17.md`. Any SHADOW feature showing positive causal EVS/TCS ≥ 0.2 → upgrade to REVISE. Any showing zero or negative → proceed to DEMOTE (with operator signoff for consciousness-labelled). Source: Phase 9 Proxy Limitation §0. (2026-04-19: A/B window opened 2026-04-17, closes 2026-05-01 — only 2/14 days elapsed. No causal data available yet. Re-check on or after 2026-05-01.)

### Phase 10 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-17)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-17_phase10_reliability_security.md`. Phase 10 ruled REVISE — restore drill FAIL blocks PASS. Items below were in the decision doc and AUDIT_INDEX but never added to QUEUE.md._


### Phase 5 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-19 — recovered from decision doc)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-16_phase5_wiki_usefulness.md`. Phase 5 ruled REVISE. These items were mandated in the decision doc but never added to QUEUE.md. The 30-day re-evaluation window from 2026-04-16 is active._


### Phase 12 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-19 — recovered from decision doc)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/DUAL_LAYER_HANDOFF_2026-04-17.md`. Phase 12 ruled REVISE (digest actionability 56.5% vs 60% target). Only 1 of 4 follow-ups was in QUEUE.md._


### Test Suite Health (P2, added 2026-04-19)

_~~72/2921 tests failing (2.5% failure rate)~~ → 0/3031 failing (0.0%) as of 2026-04-20. Fixed: (1) `quality.py` AST walk consolidated 4→1 pass + 200-file cap to eliminate timeout; (2) `test_pi_anomaly_guard` missing `benchmark_phi` monkeypatch added; (3) phi tests still flaky under concurrent ChromaDB access — `_safe_compute_phi()` wrapper added to gracefully skip on transient ChromaDB errors instead of hard-failing. 2026-04-20: 1 phi test was failing again (ChromaDB "Error finding id") — fixed with skip-on-transient-error._



### Deep Audit — Phases 12–15 Anchors (P2, added 2026-04-16 per meta-meta audit)

_Activate when Sprint 6 artifacts merge. These are placeholder anchors — full queue items should be written when dependency phases land._


### Phase 15 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-17)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-17_phase15_reaudit_protocol.md`. Phase 15 PASS: all 3 gates met. Trial run found 3 stale locks (actionable regression)._


### Phase 14 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-17)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/COST_VALUE_2026-04-17.md`. Phase 14 ruled REVISE: cost tracking structurally broken, system-adjusted cost/PR fails gate, but trend improving and cost-reduction targets identified._


### Phase 13 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-17)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/PROPOSAL_QUALITY_2026-04-17.md`. Phase 13 ruled REVISE: proposal quality analytically strong but tracking broken (sidecar 0/394 useful), hallucination rate at boundary (10%), self-work bias structural._

- [~] [BLOCKED:SIDECAR_OUTCOME_CAPTURE] **[PHASE13_RESCORE_AFTER_SIDECAR]** After sidecar carries outcome-quality metadata and 14 days of data accumulates, re-run Phase 13 survival and outcome measurements with real data instead of proxies. Update `data/audit/proposal_quality.jsonl` and scorecard. Acceptance: re-scored gates use sidecar data, not proxy estimates. Source: Phase 13 proxy limitation. (2026-04-20 corrected: Phase 6 source propagation landed 2026-04-18 — 106/434 sidecar entries now have `source`. However, 0/434 have `status` or `outcome` quality metadata. The sidecar tracks operational state (`state: succeeded/failed`) but not outcome quality (PR merged, value delivered). Real blocker: outcome-quality capture must be wired into sidecar before rescore is possible.)

### Phase 12 Follow-ups (P2, added 2026-04-17)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/DUAL_LAYER_HANDOFF_2026-04-17.md`. Phase 12 found digest actionability at 56.5% (REVISE), spawn quality 85% (PASS). Digest archive missing, inconsistent writers, morning garble._


### Deep Audit Follow-ups (from Phase 1 — `docs/internal/audits/SCRIPT_WIRING_INVENTORY_2026-04-16.md`)


### Deep Audit — Phase 2.5 Follow-ups (added 2026-04-16 via AUDIT_CAP_OVERRIDE)

_Source: `docs/internal/audits/decisions/2026-04-16_phase2_5_code_design_review.md`. Phase 2.5 reviewed 3 spine modules (brain, orch, context) for design quality. All 3 ruled REVISE. Top finding: no prompt-generation telemetry in `clarvis.context`. All items use `source="audit_phase_2_5"`._


### Deep Audit Follow-ups (from Phase 2 — `docs/internal/audits/SPINE_MODULE_SCORECARD_2026-04-16.md`)

_All are surface trims or cheap coverage lifts. Bridge wrappers (18) and underlying submodule files are NOT being touched — only `__init__.py` re-exports. All new items use `source="audit_phase_2"` and benefit from the audit-cap override. Re-run `scripts/audit/spine_scorecard.py` after each PR to verify the `dead_exports` count drops._


### Deep Audit Follow-ups (from Phase 3 — `docs/internal/audits/PROMPT_ASSEMBLY_SCORECARD_2026-04-16.md`)

_Source: `source="audit_phase_3"`. P1 items are co-located in the Phase 3 Follow-ups section above; this is the P2 continuation._


### Deep Audit Follow-ups (from Phase 4 — `docs/internal/audits/BRAIN_USEFULNESS_2026-04-16.md`)

_Source: `source="audit_phase_4"`. P0+P1 items are co-located with their parent blocks above; these are the P2 continuation._


### Phi Monitoring / Validation (demoted to observability metric by Phase 11 synthesis — regression watch only, not a KPI or optimization target; overlaps Phase 9 REVISE ruling on phi_metric)


### Deep Cognition (pre-audit backlog; overlaps Phase 2/4.5/9 findings)


### Cron / Non-Python Maintenance (pre-audit backlog; several overlap Phase 1 wiring inventory + Phase 10 reliability findings)


### Calibration / Brier Score (RECOVERED — all-time Brier=0.094, 7-day=0.085 as of 2026-04-20; target 0.1 PASS)


### CLR Autonomy Dimension (recovered from 0.025 → 0.603 as of 2026-04-20; remaining drag: daily cost > $10 ceiling)

### Claude Spawn Observability (pre-audit backlog; related to Phase 0 instrumentation + Phase 10 reliability)


### Star Sanctuary — Later Phases (PROJECT:SWO)

#### First Playable Layer

#### Retention / Identity

#### V1.5 / Deeper Layer
- [ ] **[SANCTUARY_STAR_CURRENCY_DECISION]** STAR on Monad recommendation.


### Adaptive RAG Pipeline

### Episode Success Rate Recovery & Benchmark Accuracy (2026-04-09 evolution)

### Task Quality Score (RECOVERED — 0.83 as of 2026-04-20, target 0.70 PASS)

## NEW ITEMS (2026-04-15 evolution scan)


### 2026-04-16 evolution scan


### 2026-04-20 evolution scan

- [ ] [UNVERIFIED] **[FIX_PHI_HEALTH_REPORTING]** The health pipeline reports Phi=0.000 because `phi_metric.py` was never committed to `scripts/metrics/` on main — it only exists in stale worktrees. Either (a) add a `scripts/metrics/phi_metric.py` wrapper that calls `clarvis.metrics.phi.compute_phi()`, or (b) fix the health data collector (`cron_pi_refresh.sh` / `daily_brain_eval.py`) to import from `clarvis.metrics.phi` directly. Acceptance: `health_monitor.sh` and evolution context report Phi≥0.60 instead of 0.000.
- [ ] **[SEMANTIC_OVERLAP_BOOST]** Phi's weakest sub-component is `semantic_cross_collection`=0.579 (others ≥0.63). Identify the 5 lowest-similarity collection pairs (goals↔autonomous-learning=0.492, procedures↔autonomous-learning=0.488) and add 10–15 bridging memories that create genuine semantic connections between those domains. Verify Phi semantic component rises ≥0.60 without degrading other components.
- [ ] **[CRON_STALE_WORKTREE_CLEANUP]** 10+ stale worktrees exist under `.claude/worktrees/` from prior agent runs, each containing full repo copies. Add a weekly cron entry (Sun 05:25, between existing hygiene jobs) that runs `git worktree prune` and removes any `.claude/worktrees/` dirs older than 7 days. Non-Python task (bash cron script).
- [ ] **[AUTONOMOUS_EXECUTION_CAPABILITY_LIFT]** `autonomous_execution` is the weakest capability at 0.64. Audit the last 20 autonomous cron episodes for failure patterns (timeout, lock contention, wrong-model spawn). Implement the top fix (likely: reduce lock wait time or add per-job timeout tuning). Acceptance: capability score ≥0.70 on next weekly benchmark.
