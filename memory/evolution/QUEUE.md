# Evolution Queue — Clarvis

_Pick from here every heartbeat. Small tasks: do now. Big tasks: spawn Claude Code._
_Priority: P0 (do now) > P1 (this week) > P2 (when idle)_
_Completed items auto-archived to QUEUE_ARCHIVE.md._

## P0 — 14-Day Delivery Window (Deadline: 2026-03-31)


### Delivery Goal
Presentable Clarvis by 2026-03-31:
- open-source-ready main repo
- working/public-ready website v0
- clean repo boundaries and consolidation plan
- stronger Clarvis brain / recall / context quality
- reliable orchestration and benchmarks
- clearly wired, tested, maintainable structure

### March 24 audit note
_Queue audited on 2026-03-24 evening. Removed 3 completed items (A5_A7, TEMPORAL_RETRIEVAL_FIX, BACKFILL_SENTINEL_FIX). Demoted 2 items (postflight import cleanup, semantic bridges) to P1 — functional via bridges, not release-blocking. 7 items remain on the critical path._

### Milestone C — Repo / Open-Source Readiness (by 2026-03-26) ✅ COMPLETE

### Milestone D — Public Surface (by 2026-03-29)

### Milestone E — Final Validation (by 2026-03-31)

## P2 — When Idle (Demoted 2026-03-17)

### Spine Migration
- [~] [SPINE_MIGRATION_WAVE3_ORCH] Migrate orchestrator logic from `scripts/` into `clarvis/orch/`. _(Phase 1 done 2026-03-10. Remaining: `pr_factory.py`, `project_agent.py`, `agent_orchestrator.py`, benchmarks/scoreboard.)_
- [~] [LEGACY_SCRIPT_WRAPPER_REDUCTION] Audit high-value Python scripts and convert mature ones into thin wrappers over canonical `clarvis.*` modules. _(2026-03-10: 3 scripts wrapped. Remaining: context_compressor, heartbeat_{pre,post}flight.)_
- [~] [CRON_CANONICAL_ENTRYPOINTS] Migrate cron paths from direct `python3 scripts/X.py` to `python3 -m clarvis ...`. _(3 done. Next: context_compressor gc.)_

### Code Quality

### Agent Orchestrator
- Pillar 2 Phase 5 — Visual Ops Dashboard _(PixiJS-based ops visualization. Design in `docs/CLAW_EMPIRE_VISUALS_NOTES_2026-03-06.md`.)_

### Benchmarking
- CLR Benchmark implementation from fork: `clarvis/metrics/clr.py` (672 lines, schema v1.0 frozen, 6 dimensions).
- A/B Comparison Benchmark: fix `ab_comparison_benchmark.py` — temp file prompts, 10+ pairs, measure success/quality/duration.

### Adaptive RAG Pipeline
_Design: `docs/ADAPTIVE_RAG_PLAN.md` — 4-phase rollout (GATE → EVAL → RETRY → FEEDBACK). Each phase independently useful. Demoted: not needed for 2026-03-31 delivery._

### Research Sessions
_(Completed items archived.)_

- [ ] [BRIEF_COMPRESSION_STABILITY] Brief compression ratio dropped from 0.615→0.550 (at target boundary). Audit `context_compressor.py` extractive-then-abstractive pipeline: check if recent brain growth (2666→2761 memories) is inflating pre-compression token counts without proportional summary improvement. Add adaptive pruning of low-salience brain hits before compression. Target: stable ≥0.58.
- [ ] [INTRA_DENSITY_BOOST] Intra-collection density is weakest Phi component (0.434 vs next-lowest 0.67). Run `graph_compaction.py` intra-collection linking pass: for each collection, find top-50 nearest-neighbor pairs by embedding distance and add edges where missing. Validate Phi intra_density ≥0.50 afterward.
- [ ] [HEALTH_MONITOR_METRIC_EXPORT] (Bash) Extend `scripts/health_monitor.sh` to emit a machine-readable JSON summary (`monitoring/health_latest.json`) alongside the human log. Include: brain_count, cron_ok_count, cron_fail_count, disk_pct, gateway_status, phi, pi. Enables downstream dashboards and alerting without log-parsing.
- [ ] [ACTION_FAILURE_TRIAGE] 45 action-type episode failures dominate the failure distribution (vs 14 timeout, 7 system). Sample 10 recent action failures from episodes, classify root causes (bad tool call, wrong model, missing context, etc.), and file a short report in `memory/research/action-failure-triage.md` with top-3 actionable fixes.
